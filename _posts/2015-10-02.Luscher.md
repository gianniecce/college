## Luscher model 

Solidarity : dense supportive ties / low conflict. High support is promoted to avoid conflict. 
Low ambivalence. 

Captivation : low support - high conflict. Family obligations. Low ambivalence. 

Atomization : low support - low conflict. Low ambivalence. "family members are not interconnected". 

Emancipation : high support - high conflict. Negotiate autonomy in dense family. 

> This result is consistent with previous findings stressing that the availability of resources 
contributes to sustaining support within family configurations, 
whereas their scarcity challenges the balance of support exchanges 
within family networks (Connidis, 2003; Hillcoat-Nallétamby - Phillips, 2011; Offer, 2012). 
Fewer resources mean being less able to sustain reciprocity in family ties, especially when coupled with support needs. 
This creates strain on family members who feel that they have 
to fulfil their family obligations (Lüscher - Pillemer, 1998; Connidis - McMullin, 2002; Willson - Shuey - Elder - Wickrama, 2006). 
Such situations lead to tensions and conflict throughout family configurations and, sometimes, 
to disengagement and isolation in cases of severely limited resources (Offer, 2012).
